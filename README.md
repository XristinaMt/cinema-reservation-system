In this system, a user can freely browse and view the information of the available films, however, if he/she wishes to book a ticket he/she must be a registered user. For this purpose, the user who wishes to make a reservation, when he clicks on the date and time of the film he wishes to view, the system will redirect him to a page where he can either register or log in to his account in case he had previously registered. Then, once the registration has been made (in the case of a new user), and the user has also proceeded to log in to his account, he will be able to select the seats he wishes to reserve.
As far as the administrator is concerned, apart from booking tickets which he can do if he wishes, he also has some product management functions at his disposal. In particular, he will be able to delete/add movies, reservations and users.
